# Exploring-Meteorological-Events-And-Natural-Disasters-Data-of-USA-
This document is about exploring and extracting some insights from the Storm Data which is an official publication of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Across the USA starting from 1950 to 2011 meteorological events are observed with its results such as injuries, fatalities and damages on crops and on properties. We are going to investigate if event types are correlated with damage types.
At first section We will download the data and clean some of it, transform the data, look at columns and group events to have ideas which events are more dangerous for human life and have strong impact on economy. We will compare top events that effects most. We will plot our data to understand better and see relations between events and damages. And we will examine by years and also by seasons of events. This data can be investigated by different points of view. But for more detailed analysis data has to be cleaned very carefully. Especially between 1950-1970 some stats are missing or deployed with personal measurements.
